This is the source for the GhettoBox CSS library. Soon I will post instructions on how to build/contribute.

In the meantime see the [website](http://powerfulwizard.net/ghetto-box-live-site/) for documentation.

The repo for the website itself is at [ghetto-box-site](https://github.com/walkerab/ghetto-box-site/). This is where you go if you want to make changes to the documentation or examples.
